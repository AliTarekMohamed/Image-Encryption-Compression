# Analysis & Design of Algorithms Project 2024 
## Image Encryption and Compression
 
- Implementing Image encoding and decoding algorithms to prepare the image for encryption and compression processes
  Utilizing Huffman coding for Compression process 

- Implementing Huffman Tree-based algorithms for decompression process

### Project Requirements (Input & Output)
**Stage 1: Image Encoding and Compression**

Input: 2D image array, initial seed, and tap position.
Output: A binary file containing the initial seed, tap position, Huffman Tree, and compressed image.

**Stage 2: Image Decompression and Decoding**

Input: Binary file from Stage 1.
Output: The original image.
